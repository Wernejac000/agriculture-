Intro:
This is a text based game I wrote in C that is loosely based off the text game 'Hamurabi'.
'Hamurabi' was originally written in 1968 in FOCAL for the pdp-8 under the name
'King of Sumeria' or 'The Summer Game'. It was also ported in 1971 to DEC BASIC 
and in 1973 it was publish in '101 BASIC Computer Games'. I used the source code provided in 
this book as a basis for my game, although I can only vaguely understand the code, since I've 
used basic for other systems;as well as, ports for C# and Fortran (both languages I don't know 
but had parts that made sense). The only versions I've played are the C# and Fortran ports. I 
wrote this for use in the Linux terminal and has not been tested for Windows or Mac, but probably
can easily be ported. I've also tested this in Termux on an Android and it works the same as on Linux.

Compilation (Linux only):
$clang agriculture.c -o agriculture  OR
$gcc agriculture.c -o agriculture

run code:
./agriculture
